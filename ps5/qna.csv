3.2,"Pepper plants can either be tall or short. Plant height is determined by a single gene, which we will call the height gene. These plants can either be allowed to self-fertilize, or can be crossed with another plant. You have true-breeding (aka pure-breeding) tall and short plants available.

Use the letters H or h to represent the alleles for plant height. Use the uppercase letter to denote the allele encoding the dominant phenotype and the lowercase letter to denote the allele encoding the recessive phenotype.

You set up a single cross that allows you to experimentally determine that the tall phenotype is dominant in pepper plants.

You have two pepper plants that you are interested in testing: plant 1 and plant 2. Both plant 1 and plant 2 are tall. You cross plant 1 and plant 2 with each other and observe that all 100 progeny are tall.
Which of the following statements is FALSE? Select the best answer.","1. Plant 1 and Plant 2 are both true-breeding.
2. Both Plant 1 and Plant 2 have the genotype Hh.
3. Plant 1 is true-breeding, and Plant 2 is Hh.
4. Plant 1 is Hh, and Plant 2 is true-breeding.","2- Both Plant 1 and Plant 2 have the genotype Hh.
"
3.3,"Pepper plants can either be tall or short. Plant height is determined by a single gene, which we will call the height gene. These plants can either be allowed to self-fertilize, or can be crossed with another plant. You have true-breeding (aka pure-breeding) tall and short plants available.

Use the letters H or h to represent the alleles for plant height. Use the uppercase letter to denote the allele encoding the dominant phenotype and the lowercase letter to denote the allele encoding the recessive phenotype.

You set up a single cross that allows you to experimentally determine that the tall phenotype is dominant in pepper plants.

You decide to observe another trait in your study of pepper plants -
pepper color. In your plants the color red is dominant (R), while the color yellow is
recessive (r), controlled by a single gene.

The plant you are working with is a red, tall pepper plant, but you are not sure if it is true-breeding or not.
Which of the following plants should you cross with your red, tall pepper plant in order to
identify whether your red, tall plant is true-breeding? Select the best answer.","1. RRHH
2. RrHh
3. rrHH 
4. RRhh 
5. rrhh",5- rrhh
3.4,"Which of the following results of the cross described in the prior question (Q3.3) would indicate that your red, tall pepper plant is homozygous for both the height and pepper color genes? Select the best answer.","1. All progeny are red and tall.
2. All progeny plants are yellow and short.
3. The progeny display all FOUR possible combinations of red/yellow pepper color
and short/tall height.","1- All progeny are red and tall.
"
3.5,"Which of the following results of the cross described in Q3.3 would indicate that your red, tall pepper plant is heterozygous for both the height and pepper color genes? Select the best answer.","1. All progeny are red and tall.
2. All progeny plants are yellow and short.
3. The progeny display all FOUR possible combinations of red/yellow pepper color
and short/tall height.","3- The progeny display all FOUR possible combinations of red/yellow pepper color and short/tall height.
