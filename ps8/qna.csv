2.1,"You are reading a research paper detailing a DNA microarray experiment comparing the transcriptional profiles of wild-type skin cells versus induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells generated from skin cells. The mRNA was isolated from the skin and iPS cells and reverse transcribed into cDNA.

The authors of the paper made the following conclusions:
• Genes A and B significantly decreased in expression level in iPS cells compared
to skin cells
• Genes C and D displayed no significant difference in expression level between
iPS and skin cells
