This is because white blood cells called B cells are constantly producing antibodies in response to any antigen they encounter, including potential pathogens like the Ebola virus. When you are exposed to a specific receptor on the surface of a B cell stimulates that cell to divide, producing a clone of genetically identical cells to fight that invader. These B cells have extensive endoplasmic reticulum for synthesizing antibodies. Therefore, your body has the potential to produce antibodies against the Ebola virus if you are ever exposed to it.",True,False

These include diversity, immunologic memory, and the involvement of macrophages and dendritic cells. The human body contains tens of thousands of different molecules, each with a specific three-dimensional structure capable of generating immune responses. Thus, every cell in the body has a tremendous number of antigens. When the adaptive immune system recognizes an antigen, it responds by activating lymphocytes of the appropriate specificity.

After the adaptive immune system responds to a particular type of pathogen once, it develops immunological memory, which allows it to usually respond more rapidly and powerfully to the same threat in the future. This immunological memory helps protect us from repeats of childhood diseases such as chicken pox. Macrophages and dendritic cells play a key role in activating the adaptive immune system by ingesting pathogens or infected host cells, displaying fragments of the pathogen on their cell surfaces, and presenting antigens to immature T cells in lymph nodes. They also secrete cytokines and other signals that stimulate the activation and differentiation of T cells.",False,False

This region is responsible for binding to the specific epitope on the antigen. The interaction between the antibody's variable region and the antigen's epitope is similar to the active site of an enzyme in that both involve specific interactions with their respective substrates. However, while the active site of an enzyme is a well-defined, stable structure, the variable regions of antibodies can be highly diverse due to the rearrangement of genes during somatic recombination. This diversity allows for the specific recognition and binding to various antigens.",False,False

In this context, it is mentioned that innate immunity evolved very early in animals and that a class of receptors called Toll-like receptors (TLRs) participates in innate defense responses. These receptors recognize nonself molecules called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and trigger a signal transduction pathway leading to the expression of genes for anti-pathogen molecules. This pathway exists in some form in many animal groups, including humans, showing that innate immunity has a shared evolutionary basis across diverse species.",False,False
4,"You are reading a research paper detailing a DNA microarray experiment comparing the transcriptional profiles of wild-type skin cells versus induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells generated from skin cells. The mRNA was isolated from the skin and iPS cells and reverse transcribed into cDNA. The cDNA was digested and labeled with either red (skin cells) or green (iPS cells) fluorophores, and hybridized on a DNA microarray with probes specific for host genes.
The authors of the paper made the following conclusions:
• Genes A and B significantly decreased in expression level in iPS cells compared
to skin cells
• Genes C and D displayed no significant difference in expression level between
iPS and skin cells
• Genes E, F, and G significantly increased in expression level in iPS cells
compared to skin cells

It generates an incredible diversity in both antibodies (produced by B cells) and T cell receptors. Macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells are the antigen-presenting cells that display fragments of antigens bound to their surface MHC I or II proteins. T helper cells bind to these MHC II proteins on antigen-presenting cells and release cytokines that activate them to proliferate, producing a clone of TH cells with the same specificity. The steps up to this point constitute the activation phase of the humoral immune response and occur in the lymphoid tissues. In the effector phase, TH cells activate previously unexposed B cells with the same specificity to produce antibodies.",False,False
