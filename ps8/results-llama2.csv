It includes physical barriers such as skin, and cellular responses involving recognition of self and nonself molecules. Recognition of nonself molecules by white blood cells leads to coordinated responses such as the production of defensive proteins and inflammation. The innate defense system does not mount an innate defense response to a speck of dust that lands on your skin, but it may mount an innate response to a bacterium because the size and shape of the bacterium are different from that of the dust particle. When a splinter of wood permeates the skin, the skin swells up due to inflammation. The events by which this occurs include:

1. The splinter pierces the skin, causing damage to the tissue and release of molecules signaling the immune system to respond.
2. White blood cells such as neutrophils recognize the splinter as nonself and launch a response involving inflammation and the production of defensive proteins.
3. Macrophages engulf the splinter and digest it, leading to further inflammation and tissue repair.
In conclusion, vaccination initiates a primary immune response, generating memory cells without making the person ill. Later, if a pathogen carrying the same antigen attacks, specific memory cells already exist and quickly overwhelm the invaders with a massive production of lymphocytes and antibodies. The finding that memory cells can last a long time and help in a response to new, related antigens is remarkable and has implications for developing broadly effective vaccines.",False,True

 1. Differentiated and cannot form any other type of cell 
2. Pluripotent and can form most cells of the organism’s body 
3. Multipotent and can form all cells that make up its particular tissue/organ","The refined answer is:

Vaccination initiates a primary immune response, generating memory cells without making the person ill. Later, if a pathogen carrying the same antigen attacks, specific memory cells already exist. They recognize the antigen and quickly overwhelm the invaders with a massive production of lymphocytes and antibodies. The remarkable finding is that memory cells can last a long time and help in a response to new, related antigens. People who were exposed to a particular strain of flu retain antibody-making memory cells against that strain for decades and develop a rapid immune response to a new, genetically different strain that appears years later.

In the case of flu, the memory cells are making antibodies that bind to not just the first strain of flu they responded to, but to later ones as well. Characterizing these antibodies provides a clue to developing a vaccine that is broadly effective and obviates the need to develop new ones (Investigating Life: What Are the Mechanisms and Implications of Long-Lasting Immunity?). As you saw in the opening story, vaccination has completely or almost completely wiped out some deadly diseases in industrialized countries.

The original answer is included below for context:
Because of mutation, an antigenic determinant on a pathogen can change over time. If the change is significant in terms of three—dimensional structure, a vaccine directed against an antigen from a pathogen may become ineffective. You are familiar with this with regard to influenza. More often than not, the annual flu season features a genetic strain of the flu virus that is not sufficiently related to the previous season’s vaccine; so a new vaccine, with new B cell clones, must be made. A remarkable recent finding is that memory cells can last a long time and help in a response to new, related antigens. People who were exposed to a particular strain of flu retain antibody-making memory cells against that strain for decades and develop a rapid immune response to a new, genetically different strain that appears years later.

This is due to the mechanism of immunoglobulin synthesis, which involves rearranging genes that encode variable regions of heavy and light chains. Each B cell has the ability to make millions of different immunoglobulins with unique specificities by recombining these genes in different ways. This results in a vast array of antibodies that can recognize and bind to various pathogens, ensuring protection against an immense diversity of potential invaders. In contrast, other biological molecules, such as enzymes, have more limited structural variability and are less diverse in their functions.

To understand how the genome encodes enough different antibodies to protect the body, consider that each mature B cell makes only one specific type of immunoglobulin. However, millions of different B cells develop in the bone marrow, each capable of producing a unique antibody. This means that there are billions of different antibodies produced by the immune system, each with its own specificity for recognizing and binding to particular pathogens.

The mechanism of DNA rearrangement during B cell development ensures that the genome encodes enough diversity to protect against a wide range of potential pathogens. This process involves the random recombination of gene segments, leading to the creation of new immunoglobulins with different variable regions. The constant regions of the heavy chains are encoded by specific genes that remain unchanged, resulting in different classes of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE).

In summary, the diversity of specific antibodies in an individual is much higher than the diversity of other biological molecules due to the unique mechanism of immunoglobulin synthesis. The genome encodes enough diversity to protect against a wide range of potential pathogens through the random recombination of gene segments during B cell development, resulting in billions of different antibodies produced by the immune system.",False,False

In the context provided, the query is asking about the mechanisms by which the adaptive immune system distinguishes between self and nonself molecules. The answer to this query can be broken down into two main points:

1. Antigenic determinants: The specific regions of an antigen that are recognized and bound by a specific antibody are called antigenic determinants or epitopes. Each T cell and each antibody is specific for a single antigenic determinant.
2. Distinguishing self from nonself: The adaptive immune system has another set of mechanisms for distinguishing self from nonself. Every cell in the body contains tens of thousands of different molecules, each with a specific threedimensional structure capable of generating immune responses. Thus, every cell in the body has a tremendous number of antigens. A crucial requirement of an individual's adaptive immune system is that it recognize the body's own antigens and not attack them.

In summary, the adaptive immune system distinguishes between self and nonself molecules through the recognition of antigenic determinants, which are specific regions of an antigen that are recognized by a specific antibody. The system has mechanisms in place to distinguish between self and nonself molecules, ensuring that it responds specifically to pathogens while ignoring the body's own molecules.",True,True

3. yellow (resulting from equal amounts of red and green)","1. MHC proteins almost always differ among unrelated people, so organ transplants usually provoke a cellular immune response by the host, causing rejection. People receiving transplants are given a drug called cyclosporine which inhibits T cell development. How do you think cyclosporine works?
Cyclosporine works by suppressing the activation and proliferation of T cells, particularly those that recognize the donor organ as foreign. It does this by binding to the nuclear receptor, a protein complex that regulates gene transcription, specifically the Forkhead box P (FOXP) protein. By inhibiting the activity of FOXP, cyclosporine reduces the expression of genes involved in T cell activation and proliferation, thereby preventing an immune response against the donor organ.
2. When a virus infects a cell, the immune system mounts an adaptive response to this infection. What are the roles of the T cell receptor and MHC protein in this response?
The T cell receptor (TCR) recognizes and binds to specific epitopes (regions) on the surface of infected cells, which presents peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins. The TCR then signals the T cell to become activated and launch an immune response against the infected cell. The MHC protein acts as a ""self"" marker, distinguishing between self and non-self antigens, and presenting peptides from the infected cell to the TCR.
3. Cancer cells often express proteins that the body has never seen, so they are targeted by the cellular adaptive immune system. In some cancers, however, Tregs are increased in numbers and activity. Why would this indicate a poor prognosis?
Tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a hallmark of cancer. An increase in Tregs is associated with a poor prognosis because these cells can suppress the immune response against cancer cells, allowing them to grow and progress unchecked. Tregs recognize and bind to specific ligands expressed on cancer cells, which leads to their suppression. This results in an impaired immune response against the cancer cells, ultimately leading to a poor prognosis.",True,True
